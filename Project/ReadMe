This folder is for the data science project.

The objective of the project is to predict the number of days a video can trend based on the views, likes, dislikes it received on the first day. This is a regression task and the dataset is downloaded from kaggle. below are the details.
This project is carried in 4 stages, this folder has all the stages details.

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/youtube-new
Description: Analyze factors contributing to trending status of videos.
1. Problem Statement
Describe the main problem the project aims to solve based on the dataset: Analyze factors
contributing to trending status of videos.
2. EDA Checklist
- Explore key variables and their distributions
- Check for missing values and outliers
- Examine relationships between main features and target variable
- Group data by relevant categories and compare statistics
- Visualize correlations with heatmaps, boxplots, histograms
3. Hypothesis Testing Ideas
- Apply t-tests, ANOVA, or Chi-square tests depending on feature types
- Test whether differences in target variable across categories are significant
- Correlation tests for numerical features
4. ML/DL Model Suggestions
- Baseline: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Linear Regression
- Advanced: Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, Neural Networks
- For time-series datasets: LSTM, GRU, Prophet
5. Visualization Suggestions
- Time-series line charts for temporal data
- Heatmaps for correlation or category combinations
- Boxplots for category vs numerical variable comparison
- Bar charts for frequency counts
- Scatter plots for two continuous variables
