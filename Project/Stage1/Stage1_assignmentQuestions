Project stage I report
Dataset Selection & Project Setup        
Total: 100 points

Group # ____________________________________________________
Project title/topic ___________________________________________
Dataset source (url or resource) ___________________________________________________________

Task 1 Problem framing (10 points)
Your understanding of the project (what you want to study or predict). 
Write 4-6 sentences describing: the task (classification/regression/..); who/what benefits from this study; why this dataset fits (size, feature).

Task 2 Dataset exploration (20 points)
Show the first 10 rows of your dataset; create a dataset dictionary:
Feature 	Type: Int / float /…	examples	Missing %
Feature 1			
Feature 2			
…			
Target variables			

Task 3 Feature exploration (40 points)
Deal with the missing values/outliers; and then create a clean dataset for the next stage analysis. 
•	Each member works on at least one important feature (≥3 features per team total). 
•	In your summary, clearly states each member’s contributions.

Task 4 Save cleaned data (10 points)
•	Save your final cleaned dataset as newdata.csv (UTF-8, includes header).
•	Place it in your GitHub repo (e.g., /data/newdata.csv). If data is too large/private, include a script to reproduce it and a README with retrieval steps.

Task 5 Delivery (20 points)
•	Notebook: Use Markdown cells to explain every step (why you did it, not just what). Upload to GitHub.
•	Export and upload HTML or PDF in canvas, together with project stage I summary.







If your group works on time-series dataset:
Task 1, same as above
Task 2: Dataset exploration (20 points)
•	Show the first 10 rows of your dataset in chronological order.
•	Create a dataset dictionary that includes the time index and all relevant features:
Feature	Type (int/float/datetime/…)	Examples	Missing %	Notes
Timestamp	datetime	2020-01-01, 2020-01-02	0%	Time index, granularity (daily, hourly, monthly)
Feature 1				
Feature 2				
…				
Target variable(s)				

(Note: Teams are encouraged to enrich their work by exploring multiple independent time-series datasets or by merging relevant external datasets. This can provide deeper insights and stronger analysis, if the integration is well-documented and justified.)
Task 3-5, same as above
