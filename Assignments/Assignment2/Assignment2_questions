Assignment 2
1. The formula for Pearson correlation is:
Given the data for X = [2,4,6], Y = [1,3,5], the
Pearson correlation coefficient r is: __________.
Show your steps.
2. Covariance is calculated as:
Given the data X = [10,12,14], Y = [8,9,10], the
covariance is: __________.
Show your steps.
3. The formula for the chi-square statistics is:
Given the observed values O = [20,30,50], E = [25,35,45], the chi-square statistic χ2 is:
__________. Show your steps.
4. The t-test statistic is calculated as:
Given the following two datasets:
X1 = [50,52,53,48,47]
X2 = [45,46,44,47,43]
The t-test statistic t is ____________. Show your steps below (Hint: s1 and s2 are the
standard deviations, which will be�∑ squared differences/(n − 1)).
5. Consider the following two sets of test scores:
Set A: 60,70,75,80,85,90,95
Set B: 50,50,55,60,65,70,100
a) Which dataset is more likely to be positively skewed? Explain the type of skewness by
comparing mean, median and mode.
b) Plot the histogram of Set A and B, respectively, clearly label the test scores and
frequency.
